This project aims to predict house prices using machine learning techniques. It involves both classification and regression models to provide a comprehensive analysis of house pricing. The goal is to accurately estimate house prices, which can be useful for buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals.
Some parts of the project are still under development. More advanced feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning are needed to further improve model performance. Contributions and suggestions are welcome!
